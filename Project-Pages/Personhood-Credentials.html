        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>Building on related concepts, like, decentralized identifiers
            (DIDs), proof-of-personhood, anonymous credentials, <strong>personhood
            credentials (PHCs)</strong> emerged as an alternative approach,
            enabling individuals to verify to digital service providers
            that they are a person without disclosing additional information. 
            However, new technologies might introduce some
            friction due to users’ misunderstandings and mismatched
            expectations. Despite their growing importance, limited
            research has been done on users’ perceptions and preferences
            regarding PHCs. <p><br> 
            To address this gap, we conducted competitor analyses, and semi-structured online user interviews
            with 27 participants from the US and EU/UK to provide
            concrete design recommendations for PHCs that incorporate
            user needs, adoption rules, and preferences. Our study (i)
            surfaces <strong>how people reason about unknown privacy and
            security guarantees of PHCs</strong> compared to current verification
            methods</strong>; (ii) presents the impact of <strong>several factors on how
            people would like to onboard and manage PHCs</strong>, including
            trusted issuers (e.g., gov), ground truth data to issue PHC (e.g.,
            biometrics, physical id), and issuance system (e.g., centralized
            vs decentralized). In a think-aloud conceptual design session,
            <strong>participants recommended a conceptualized design</strong>, such
            as periodic biometrics verification, time-bound credentials,
            visually interactive human-check, and supervision of the
            government for the issuance system. We propose actionable
            designs reflecting users’ preferences.</p>

                Our study examines user preferences for
                onboarding processes (offline vs. online), credential types (e.g., biometrics, government-issued IDs), and issuer types (government
                vs. private companies). Additionally, we propose design implications, including verification choice facilitation, credential
                portability, dynamic multi-factor verification, and decentralized issuance standards.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Our study uncovered a wide range of users’ perceptions
            regarding PHCs. Participants exhibited skepticism towards
            PHCs, partly because of “unknown risk” vectors as a new
            technology compared to traditional verification. Despite
            these concerns, we find diverse levels of adoption preferences
            influenced by the “type of data required” for PHC credential
            issuance and verification as well as personal “security standards” for different services (e.g., finance, health, government
            related). Our findings also indicate benefits including aspects
            that promote fairness by ensuring opportunities for legitimate
            users in platforms such, as gaming, and survey platforms.</p><br>
        <p>
            At the same time, we surfaced nuanced preferences of how participants
            would like to onboard and manage PHC credentials. Their
            preferences depended on the type of ground truth data
            required for issuance, along with the familiarity, usability,
            and sensitivity of those data sources. They often considered
            facial recognition more resilient verification process than
            fingerprints. Other factors influencing preferences included
            the issuing ecosystem (centralized vs. decentralized), the
            issuer (government vs. private company), and the onboarding
            method (physical vs. remote).</p><br>
        <p>
            We also identified practical design suggestions to accommodate participants’ needs, including periodic biometric
            checks and time-bound credential verification to ensure only
            the intended user accesses the credential; visually interactive human-checks to prevent social engineering during
            onboarding, collaboration between industry and government
            to establish decentralized standards for broader adoption.

                    <h3>Challenges in Identity Verification</h3>

                    <p>Current identity verification systems face several user-centered challenges. First, many require high cognitive or social effort, such as building social graphs or passing unfamiliar tests, which makes onboarding difficult. Second, account recovery processes are often unclear or unreliable—especially when users switch devices or platforms. Third, users are concerned about privacy due to inconsistent data requirements and unclear policies on how personal information is used or stored. Finally, some systems rely on physical presence or high-end devices for biometric checks, creating accessibility barriers for users in rural areas or with limited technology. These issues highlight the need for more transparent, user-friendly, and privacy-preserving verification methods.</p>

                    on their relevance to identity verification or digital identity infrastructure, 
                    contextual diversity (e.g., geographic, technical
                    focus, audience), and regulatory impact (e.g., international,
                    national, state).

                    <h3>Users’ Current Impression of PHC</h3>
                    <p>Participants had mixed impressions of PHCs and often made trade-offs between <strong>familiar security guarantees associated 
                        with traditional verification methods</strong> over the less clear assurances of emerging PHC. </p>
                    <div class="quote-box">
                    "They scan your iris, create a
                    unique code, and re-verify me again later time. I guess
                    that means they still keep some sort of data from the iris
                    scan. I would still stay with email or traditional verification
                    as I know what they are keeping. Even though world app
                    guarantees privacy with hi-tech, I don’t exactly know how
                    much privacy I have in human tests. I’m not saying it’s a
                    bad idea, it’s just i am unsure."
                    </div>
                    <p>They also discussed <strong>fairness</strong> as a potential benefit of PHCs with their experiences in the gaming and survey platforms, emphasizing that
                        personhood verification could help filter out bots and increase their chances as a genuine participant.  </p>
                    <div class="quote-box">
                        "Often time I got "time out or returned" in this platform and
                        earlier I thought I am slow responding to survey request I
                        received on my account. Lately, it happens too often, feels
                        like there are bots or a group of people are more proactive in
                        participating in surveys. honestly, it reduces the chances for
                        me being selected for research studies."
                    
                    </div>
                    <p>Participants
                        expressed concerns about potential risks, including <strong>centralized power of the issuer, uncertain regulations of
                        emerging technology, authenticity of PHC, and misuse of
                        anonymity.</strong></p>

                    <h3>Factors Influence on How People Would like to Verify Themselves</h3>
                    <p>
                    <strong>Data Requirements to Issue PHC</strong>: Participants generally categorized data requirements into
                    three main types: ➊ Government-issued IDs, such as social
                    security numbers, passports, and driver’s licenses; ➋ Biometrics, including face, fingerprints, and iris; and ➌ Digital
                    identifiers, such as phone numbers and email addresses. 
                    For instance, a government-issued ID is the most preferred
                    data to issue PHC across applications except social media
                    and llm applications. Phone number is most preferred in
                    llm application followed by Iris scan.
                    </p>
                    <div class="quote-box">
                        "Government id is gonna
                        have a lot of your personal information. biometrics here
                        minimize data-just biomarker like with iris or fingerprint,
                        it’s just the minimal and still being secure."
                    </div>
                    <p><strong>Stakeholder Types</strong>: 
                        Participants expressed varied levels of acceptance regarding the preferred issuers of PHC issuers.
                        Across all application scenarios, government entities emerged as the most trusted issuers for the majority of participants.
                        However, practical considerations influenced participants’ views in certain domains, particularly social media and LLM applications, 
                        where private companies were rated as acceptable issuers.
                    </p>
                    <div class="quote-box">
                        "Government
                        is my preferred. If there are certain organizations are
                        leveraging 3rd party organizations, they should be regulated
                        and under government supervision. The least favored one
                        is private companies without supervision."
                    </div>
                    <p><strong>Architecture Types</strong>: 
                        We observed diverse preferences for PHC architectures,
                        with participants highlighting decentralized models for improving
                        centralized data security and enabling user choice
                        of issuers. Others preferred the simplicity of centralized
                        systems, and hybrid models blending decentralization with
                        government oversight. 
                    </p>
                    <div class="quote-box">
                        "You’ve
                        created a wall between any problems with data theft, with
                        a centralized data storage. They only have to breach the
                        walls of one castle with decentralized. They have to breach
                        the walls of two different castles, which makes it a lot more
                        complex and most people won’t. Most people won’t go
                        through the trouble of doing that."

                    <h3>Design Suggestions for PHC</h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Theme 1: Time-bounded Credential for Privacy </strong> 
                        Some users expect credentials to verify personhood
                        with the least amount of personal data, avoiding detailed
                        personal or biometric data collection for a certain period.
                        Another expectation in the same line was the portability of
                        preferred credentials if they can be used across platforms
                        without re-verifying frequently. To address the amount of
                        data and period of such data collection that has been used
                        for issuing credentials, some features or design concepts
                        were – limited validity period, proof without storage or
                        pseudonymization of the data when storing it. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Theme 2: Sensitivity-based Usable Credential Choice for PHC </strong> 
                        Multiple participants expressed that their preferences are sensitivity-dependent.
                        They suggested a design to incorporate choices for end users based on their perceived
                        level of security needs across services in healthcare, finance, social media, etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Theme 3: Comprehensive Visually Interactive Human Check </strong> 
                        Another theme comes up where participants explain how “video chat” 
                        offers several advantages in preventing social attacks during personhood credential issuance 
                        by triangulating real-time interaction, visual verification, and environment check. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Theme 4: Mitigate PHC Misuse: Periodic
                            Biometrics, Dynamic Authentication, and Geo-Restricted
                            Access </strong> 
                            Participants suggested enhanced key management
                            for the PHC system to address potential misuse, such as 
                            identity selling, credential sharing, and unauthorized account setup.
                            Suggestions included periodic biometric verification 
                            (e.g., facial recognition or fingerprint scans during login) or random re-authentication
                             to ensure that only the credential holder can access the system.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Theme 5: Distribute Power Across Issuer: Decentral-
                            ized vs Centralized </strong> 
                            The main design concept focus on ensuring that any misuse of data by one 
                            entity would be immediately flagged by others and distributed control among 
                            different issuers when included as decentralized issuance systems.
                    </p>


                    

                    <h3>Future Direction</h3>
                    <p>This project is still in its early stages, and we aim to contribute to the further development

                            We will explore how PHCs can support identity verification in e-commerce ecosystems. 
                            By examining both B2B and B2C scenarios, we will investigate how experts would design PHCs within current infrastructures.
